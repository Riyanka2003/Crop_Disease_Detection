# Crop_Disease_Detection
Develop a user-friendly interface for farmers to upload crop images, which will then be analyzed by a deep learning model to identify potential diseases, enabling early detection and proactive crop protection for improved yields.

Description :-
Implementing a user interface for image uploading to facilitate the utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the automated identification of crop diseases from submitted images.

Technologies Used :-
Python, Numpy, HTML, CSS, Flask  for UI, TensorFlow for deep learning.
