# 🌾 Crop Disease Detection
A user-friendly web application that allows farmers to upload crop images, which are then analyzed using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect possible diseases. This project aims to help farmers take proactive steps in managing plant health and improving crop yield.

## 📝 Project Description
This project implements a web-based interface using **Flask**, allowing users to upload images of their crops. These images are processed by a **CNN** model trained on the **PlantVillage dataset** to identify and classify crop diseases automatically. Early detection can help in timely intervention and better agricultural outcomes.

## 🚀 Features
- 🖼️ Upload crop images via a simple web interface
- 🤖 Deep learning-powered disease detection using CNN
- 📈 Confidence score for predictions
- 🌙 Dark mode for enhanced UI experience
- 📚 Prediction history and CSV export functionality
